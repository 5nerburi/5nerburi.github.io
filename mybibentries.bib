  Abstract                 = {A critical evaluation and thermodynamic modeling study including key phase diagram experiments was performed to investigate the K2O-Al2O3 and K2O-MgO-Al2O3 systems. For the first time, potassium β- and βʹʹ-alumina solid solutions were described using the Compound Energy Formalism with accurate cation distributions in their sublattices. From the new experimental results, the stability of potassium βʹʹ-alumina was assured up to 1600 °C. A large discrepancy reported in the literature, the eutectic temperature between KAlO2 and β-alumina in the K2O-Al2O3 system, was resolved. A set of self-consistent Gibbs energy functions for all stable phases in the K2O-MgO-Al2O3 system was obtained. As a result, any phase diagram sections and thermodynamic properties of the K2O-MgO-Al2O3 system can be calculated from the optimized Gibbs energy functions. In particular, the cation distribution in the β- and βʹʹ-alumina solid solutions is calculated depending on the non-stoichiometry of solution and temperature.},

  Abstract                 = {A critical evaluation and thermodynamic optimization of all available experimental data of the Li2O-Al2O3-SiO2 system at 1 atm pressure was performed for the first time to obtain a set of consistent Gibbs energy functions of all phases in the system. The Gibbs energy of liquid oxide solution was described using the Modified Quasichemical Model with considering the formation of LiAlO2 associate component for charge compensation effect in liquid state. Various solid solutions were modeled based on their crystal structures. The obtained Gibbs energy functions can reproduce all available and reliable experimental data from 298 K to above liquidus temperatures. With the Gibbs energy description for each phase, any phase diagram and thermodynamic properties of this system and its sub-binaries can be calculated. The present thermodynamic database was applied to the thermodynamic analysis of the selective crystallization in the glass-ceramics.},
