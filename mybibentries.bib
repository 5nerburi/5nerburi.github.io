Differential scanning calorimetry measurements and equilibration/quenching experiments were performed in the Li2SiO3–MgO and Li4SiO4–Mg2SiO4 sections, respectively, using sealed Pt capsules to prevent the volatile loss of Li. According to the present experimental results, Li2MgSiO4 is the only compound present in the Li4SiO4–Mg2SiO4 isopleth, which shows a peritectic melting at 1465 ± 6°C (1738 ± 6 K). The Modified Quasichemical Model, which considers short-range ordering in the melt, was employed to describe the thermodynamic properties of the liquid phase.

In particular, the eutectic temperatures of both systems and the solubility of Li2O in solid MgO and CaO were properly measured for the first time. The eutectic temperatures of the Li2O-MgO and Li2O-CaO systems were determined to be 1696 ± 6K (1423 ± 6°C) and 1617 ± 6K (1344 ± 6°C), respectively. A solubility of 2.6mol% (1.9wt%) Li2O in solid MgO was measured at 1743 K (1470°C) and no detectable solubility of Li2O in solid CaO was determined. The present experimental results were employed for the thermodynamic modeling of the binary Li2O-MgO and Li2O-CaO systems. The phase diagrams for the binary Li2O-MgO and Li2O-CaO systems were constructed for the first time, and the phase diagram of the ternary Li2O-MgO-CaO system was predicted from the binary descriptions.},
